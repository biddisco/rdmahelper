# rdmahelper

RDMA related classes collected into a helper library for development of ib-verbs code

## Origin and background

The files in this library have been taken from the Argonne National Laboratory
source code for the Blue Gene series of computers from IBM.
The source code was originally available from Argonne's reposirory located here
https://repo.anl-external.org/repos/bgq-driver/

The directory structure used for the BGQ release has been maintained in this
repository and tags (such as V1R2M1, V1R2M2) are added with each new release 
of the BGQ source to make merging into this repo slightly easier.

The files here have been modified where necessary to support additional
functionality or fixes. Only a small subset of the BGQ source is mirrored here.
